Hello ðŸ˜€
In this project, I have several Excel files with VBA programs and form controls.

Calculator.xlsm - It literally consists of a calculator with basic actions and a sound option.
App_LoginLevels.xlsm - It's a program that requires a login to access the file. Any user can register, and an email with an access code is sent. Try it ðŸ˜‰
                       The file contains a list of clients, but it could be anything. This program distinguishes between regular accounts and administrator accounts, allowing access to hidden worksheets ðŸ¤«.
Sistema de Cadastro de Clientes.xlsm (Is in portuguese sorry) - It's a customer registration file. In the initial tab, the user enters information and adds it to a list on the next tab.
DolarCotation.xlsm - It is a program that takes the dollar exchange rate from a web page.
Form Controls - These are files with some examples of what can be done with Form Controls

The purpose of these programs is to demonstrate what Excel is capable of. And it's capable of much more. I've already developed more advanced programs in my job.

If you have any questions, let me know and contact me!
